# Driver Fatigue Detection | OpenCV
This repo can detect and track user's eyes and mouth and alert when the user is feeling drowsy using video processing techniques.

## Applications
The AAA says that 30% of all fatal accidents in the USA are due to drowsiness! We can only imagine what the stats are like for India which has a higher road accident rate. This system can be used by riders who tend to drive for a longer period of time to warn them and and prevent accidents.
